- [PostGIS](http://postgis.net) 2.1.4
- Procedural languages: [PL/pgSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/plpgsql.html), [PL/Perl](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/plperl.html), [PL/Python](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/plpython.html), and [PLV8 (Javascript)](https://code.google.com/p/plv8js/wiki/PLV8)
- Popular extensions, including [hstore](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/hstore.html) and [uuid-ossp](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/uuid-ossp.html), and more
- A number of [command-line utilities](https://github.com/postgresapp/postgresapp#command-line-utilities) for managing PostgreSQL and working with GIS data
